## What is covariance and correlation? How are they related?

Both covariance and correlation are associated with random variables as against variance which is associated with the different values of the same variable. 

Covariance divided by standard deviation of the variables is correlation and hence correlation doesn't have any units. Additionally, the value of correlation is normalised between -1 and 1 which implies that we can determine the degree to which the two variables are related.

Covariance is quiet helpful in linear regression techniques and is used to estimate the value of m in the equation - <br>
